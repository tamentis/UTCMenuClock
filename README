This is my very own hack of this nice little program to display the two clocks
that matter to me at that time, UTC and CET.  It's probably not useful to you
unless you fork and update.

This is an obscenely simple program to add the UTC time to the MacOS
Menu Status Bar. I desperately wanted two clocks as the network that I
work on uses UTC Time exclusively for all of our devices. Converting
in my head was a true pain.

The latest version is 1.2a for Mac OS 10.6 and 10.7 (Intel) downloadable from
GitHub in the Downloads section:

Compiled under XCode 4 and MacOS 10.7. It will run just fine in all
current MacOS versions, including Yosemite (10.10)

NOTE: After you install this software, you still have to run it to use it:   

Double-click "UTCMenuClock" in your /Applications folder. If you want it to 
start automatically every time you log in , click on the UTC clock in the menu 
bar and select "Open At Login"
